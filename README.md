# 🧬 Molecular Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a complete machine learning pipeline to classify molecular data into binary outcomes (`Positive` / `Negative`).

---

## 🎯 Goal
Develop a robust ML pipeline to classify records as `Positive` or `Negative` based on molecular and biochemical features.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Rows**: 7,832 samples  
- **Features**: 103 numerical descriptors of molecular sequences  
- **Target**: `Class` (Positive / Negative)

---

## 🛠️ Techniques used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Outlier Detection & Handling (Quantile-based Flooring & Capping)
- Feature Selection (Correlation threshold, Variance filtering)
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
- Handling Class Imbalance (SMOTE)
- Model Comparison (RF, SVM, XGBoost, etc.)
- Hyperparameter Tuning (RandomizedSearchCV)
- Final pipeline using `sklearn.Pipeline`
